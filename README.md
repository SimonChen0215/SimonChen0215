- 👋 Hi, I’m Simon
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Python, Java and Machine Learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to build more projects in github to practice my coding skills, and I really enjoy creating things and analyze different trends/numbers.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learn coding all by myself, and I believe I will be an excellent data analyst/scientist in the future.
